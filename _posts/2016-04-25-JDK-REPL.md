title: JDK9 REPL JShell - this is some exciting stuff!
---

A couple of years ago I worked in a project with a Python backend. As I had only used python as a script language before I soon grew to really love the powerful interactive console that let me explore and learn the language (and which saved me a few hours of debugging every week). The interactive console is the thing I miss most when I'm in my Java codebase, but fear not, with JDK9 we as Java developers will also gain the benefit of a REPL!
